# Contributing to Nyxialith

## Current Status

We're currently in heavy development mode building out the core system.

For now, the best way to contribute is through:
- **Bug reports** – If something breaks, let us know
- **Feature requests** – Tell us what you'd like to see

Use the [issue tracker](../../issues) and pick the appropriate template.

We appreciate all feedback as we build towards v1.0!
